# Academic Performance Analysis Dashboard
Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze academic performance metrics. The project includes data visualization for student grades, subject-wise performance, and trends over time, enabling educators to make data-driven decisions. Implemented KPIs, drill-through features, and filters to enhance usability. This dashboard helps in identifying performance gaps and improving educational strategies.

# ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Comprehensive Performance Tracking â€“ Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor student grades and academic performance. It provides a clear visualization of subject-wise scores and overall achievements. Educators can quickly assess student progress and identify performance trends.

- Trend Analysis & Insights â€“ The dashboard analyzes historical data to detect performance patterns over different academic periods. It highlights key strengths and areas needing improvement based on subject-wise and overall performance. This helps institutions implement targeted learning strategies.

- Interactive Data Exploration â€“ Users can apply filters and drill-through features to analyze specific students, subjects, or academic terms. The dashboard enables deep data exploration to uncover insights. This enhances decision-making by providing precise and detailed information.

- KPI Integration â€“ Key performance indicators (KPIs) are implemented to benchmark academic success. The dashboard tracks pass rates, average scores, and subject-wise performance metrics. These KPIs help in setting academic goals and monitoring progress effectively.

# ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- Student Performance Evaluation â€“ Develop a structured approach to assess academic performance across subjects and terms. Enable educators to track individual and group progress efficiently through data visualization.

- Trend Analysis & Insights â€“ Identify patterns in student performance over time to highlight strengths and areas for improvement. Facilitate data-driven decisions to enhance learning outcomes and teaching strategies.

- Interactive & User-Friendly Dashboard â€“ Implement dynamic filters, drill-through analysis, and real-time updates. Ensure an intuitive experience for educators to explore data and extract meaningful insights effortlessly.

- Data-Driven Decision Making â€“ Provide actionable insights to institutions for targeted academic interventions. Support evidence-based strategies to improve student success rates and overall institutional performance.

# ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
